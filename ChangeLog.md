2014.06.12 Version 0.1.0

ALL
* The package has been renamed to azure-storage.
* There is no separate azure-common sub-package. Everything is condensed into a single package called azure-storage.
* azure.create*Service supports the following configurations:
	* create*Service(connection string)
	* create*Service(account name, account key)
	* create*Service(storage host, sasToken)
* Added the ability to choose which SAS Version to use when generating Shared Access Signatures (either the 2012-02-12 or 2013-08-15 versions).
* Host can be given as either an object with primaryHost and secondaryHost or as a string representing the primary.
* The order credentials are assessed is consistent: If parameters are passed in, they and they alone are honored. There is no mixing (ex, if users pass in host, they won't get the access key from your env var). If no parameters are passed in, the env vars are used. Within both those strategies, the order of evaluation is emulator (in the case of EMULATED env var only), connection string, account/key or SAS, anonymous. If account/key and SAS are passed in, an error is thrown indicating the credentials are invalid.
* Removed the ability to create a storage service from a config file.
* azure.create*Service supports secondaryHost only, but either primaryHost or secondaryHost must be provided.
* Storage service client constructors take the sasToken rather than a credentials object, meaning that the SharedAccessSignature class no longer needs to be used by consumers.
* Ensure request is always built/signed for every retry attempt.
* Custom retry policies should implement the shouldRetry method and return an object with the retryInterval and retryable information in it. Optionally, they can also set the locationMode and targetLocation to which the request should be sent.
* Implemented RA-GRS support. For more information on this, please see - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/12/04/introducing-read-access-geo-replicated-storage-ra-grs-for-windows-azure-storage.aspx
* Service properties updated: replaced metrics with hour metrics and minute metrics, added cors support, added defaults if properties are unspecified to reduce invalid xml exceptions.
* Added maximum execution time, settable for all requests via {blob|queue|table}service.defaultMaximumExecutionTime or for an individual request via options.maximumExecutionTime. This applies to all requests except blob downloads.
* The blob, queue and table services no longer set/modify any values within the options object optionally passed in by the user for every API. 
* Fixed an issue where null, empty and white-space only metadata header values were allowed.
* "timeout" query parameter will not be sent to the server if not set by the user. In order to set the timeout per API, please use options.timeoutIntervalInMs. To set it for all requests made via a particular service, please use {blob|queue|table}Service.defaultTimeoutIntervalInMs.
* ECONNRESET is handled in the retry policy filter.
* DevStore with secondary access is supported.
* Set*Acl takes signed identifiers as a parameter - before it was in options.
* GenerateSharedAccessSignature() produces a query string rather than an object.
* The SharedKey class has the methods to create shared access signatures. These should not be in the SharedAccessSignature class because one can only create a SAS if they have the account/key. 
* The service client no longer evaluates the port and protocol set on it. Before, if storageserviceclient.host was called and port and protocol had been changed after host was set, host would be incorrect. 
* Removed SharedKeyLite and SharedKeyLiteTable in favor of SharedKey and SharedKeyTable which were already the defaults.
* Added separate utility files for Blob, Queue, Table, and Storage. These contain useful enums that were previously found in a single Constants file as well as new utility functions. The old Constants file will mostly include internal-use constants.

BLOB
* createBlobServiceWithSas has been provided to create a blobService to use with a Shared Access Signature. Users can create a blobService using azure.createBlobServiceWithSas(host, sasToken).
* Anonymous access for the blob service is supported.
* Added support for 2013-08-15 Blob SAS changes.
* Renamed listBlobs to listBlobsSegmented and added listBlobsSegmentedWithPrefix. listBlobsSegmented takes in currentToken and listBlobsSegmentedWithPrefix takes in prefix and currentToken along with other parameters. Please look at the documentation of these APIs for a list of parameters that users can set on the options object. These APIs return only error, result and response. The result contains entries which is a list of blobs and a continuation token for successive listing operations.
* Renamed copyBlob to startCopyBlob.
* Renamed putBlockBlobFromStream to _putBlockBlobFromStream and putBlockBlobFromFile to _putBlockBlobFromFile. These are internal methods and should not be called by users directly. Please use createBlockBlobFromStream and createBlockBlobFromFile.
* Renamed page methods: listBlobRegions to listPageRanges, createBlobPagesFromText to createPagesFromText, clearBlobPages to clearPageRanges.
* Renamed block methods: createBlobBlockFromStream to createBlockFromStream, createBlobBlockFromText to createBlockFromText, commitBlobBlocks to commitBlocks, listBlobBlocks to listBlocks.
* BlobService lease methods also work with container leases, simply specify null for the blob parameter.
* Added changeLease method to modify the lease ID of an active lease.
* Fixed lease issues, break lease allows a leaseBreakPeriod of 0, lease time header is returned as an int rather than a string.
* Added snapshot delete options: when deleting a blob with snapshots, users can decide to delete blob and snapshots or just snapshots. The options are provided in BlobUtilities.SnapshotDeleteOptions.*.
* deleteBlob callback does not return isSuccessful.
* Added does{Container|Blob}Exist methods in blobservice that can be used to determine if a particular container or blob exists.
* Added delete{Container|Blob}IfExists methods in blobservice that can be used to delete a container or a blob only when they exist.
* Added ContentMD5 validation for blob downloads. This is turned on by default for all block blob downloads and all page blob range downloads as long as the range is less than 4MB. In order to turn this off, set options.disableContentMD5Validation to true explicitly.
* x-ms-range-get-content-md5 is set internally by the library and users do not have to specify it in the options.
* Removed the option of doing range downloads while downloading a blob to text.
* Added sequence number support for page blobs. Users can set the sequence number of a page blob using blobService.setPageBlobSequenceNumber and manage concurrency issues using x-ms-if-sequence-number-le, x-ms-if-sequence-number-lt and x-ms-if-sequence-number-eq. Please see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ee691975.aspx for more details about using sequence numbers.
* Removed createBlob API. Please use createPageBlob and createBlockBlob* APIs to create the respective blobs.
* Renamed createPagesFromText to _createPagesFromText. This is an internal method and should not be called by users directly.
* Added resizePageBlob that can be used to resize a page blob. 
* createPageBlob takes in the blob's sequence number using options.sequenceNumber.
* All the BlobService APIs that took cacheControl/cacheControlHeader, contentType/contentTypeHeader, contentEncoding/contentEncodingHeader, contentLanguage/contentLanguageHeader, contentMD5/contentMD5Header in options only take cacheControl, contentType, contentEncoding, contentLanguage and contentMD5. These are the values that will be set on the blob at the server.
* createPagesFromStream takes in the following 2 options - useTransactionalMD5 to calculate and send/validate content MD5 for each transaction and contentMD5 which is an optional hash value. When contentMD5 is provided, the client library uses that instead of trying to calculate it based on the data being uploaded.
* createBlockBlobFromText, createBlockFromStream and createBlockFromText allows users to set useTransactionalMD5 on options to calculate and send/validate content MD5 for each transaction.
* Added createWriteStreamToBlockBlob, createWriteStreamToNewPageBlob and createWriteStreamToExistingPageBlob that provide a stream for writing to the blob.
* Added createReadStream that provides a stream for reading from the blob.
* blobService can have a default parallelOperationThreadCount which specifies the number of parallel upload operations that may be performed when uploading a blob that is greater than the value specified by singleBlobPutUploadThresholdInBytes. This value can be set using blobService.parallelOperationThreadCount. The default value set on blobService is 1.
* createBlockBlobFromText supports text Buffers in addition to strings.
* createBlockBlobFromText will throw an error if the uploaded content exceeds 64MB.
* BlobService getBlobUrl has been renamed to getUrl as it can also produce container urls. It can no longer create a SAS token (it used to take sharedAccessPolicy) but can take a sasToken produced by the generateSharedAccessSignature method and produce a url with that.

QUEUE
* Added Shared Access Signatures for queues. createQueueServiceWithSas has been provided to create a queueService to use with a Shared Access Signature. Users can create a queueService using azure.createQueueServiceWithSas(host, sasToken).
* Renamed listQueues to listQueuesSegmented and added listQueuesSegmentedWithPrefix. listQueuesSegmented takes in currentToken and listQueuesSegmentedWithPrefix takes in prefix and currentToken along with other parameters. Please look at the documentation of these APIs for a list of parameters that users can set on the options object. These APIs return only error, result and response. The result contains entries which is a list of queues and a continuation token for successive listing operations.
* deleteQueue and deleteMessage callbacks do not return isSuccessful.
* Added an option in the queue service to turn base 64 encoding off.

TABLE
* Added Shared Access Signatures for tables. createTableServiceWithSas has been provided to create a tableService to use with a Shared Access Signature. Users can create a tableService using azure.createTableServiceWithSas(host, sasToken).
* Added JSON support for tables and removed AtomPub. For the different flavours of JSON supported, please see - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/12/05/windows-azure-tables-introducing-json.aspx.
* Renamed queryTables to listTablesSegmented and added listTablesSegmentedWithPrefix. listTablesSegmented takes in currentToken and listTablesSegmentedWithPrefix takes in prefix and currentToken along with options and callback. Please look at the documentation of these APIs for a list of parameters that users can set on the options object. These APIs return only error, result and response. The result contains entries which is a list of tables and a continuation token for successive listing operations.
* deleteTable and deleteEntity callbacks do not return isSuccessful.
* queryEntities in TableService returns 3 parameters instead of 4: the entities and queryResultContinuation parameters are returned within a queryResult object.
* Added support for disabling echo content in inserts. By default, inserts do not echo content.
* Changed table error parsing so that the code string and message string are directly accessible from the error object.
* Removed the getTable method; doesTableExist works similarly.
* createTable does not request content back from the service, but still returns an object containing the TableName.
* Renamed queryEntity in TableService to retrieveEntity.
* Modified how batches work. Instead of turning the service batch mode on/off, a batch is a separate entity like query. Batches are constructed and then executed.
* queryEntities in TableService requires a continuation token.
* TableService updateEntity, mergeEntity and deleteEntity do not take a checkEtag option. The entity's etag is sent if it exists, otherwise * is sent.
* retrieveEntity and queryEntities accept empty partition and row keys.
* Added entity-property-creation helper methods. Users can use the entityGenerator provided in TableUtilities and create entity properties as follows:
	var entGen = TableUtilities.entityGenerator;
	var entity = { 	PartitionKey: entGen.String('part2'),
					RowKey: entGen.String('row1'),
					boolValueTrue: entGen.Boolean(true),
					boolValueFalse: entGen.Boolean(false),
					intValue: entGen.Int32(42),
					dateValue: entGen.DateTime(new Date(Date.UTC(2011, 10, 25))),
					complexDateValue: entGen.DateTime(new Date(Date.UTC(2013, 02, 16, 01, 46, 20)))
				 };
* Removed TableQuery whereKeys method. Instead of tableQuery.whereKeys, tableService.retrieveEntity should be used. 
* Removed TableQuery whereNextKeys method. Instead of tableQuery.whereNextKeys, tableService.queryEntities takes currentToken which can be retrieved from a previous queryEntities call in results.
* Removed TableQuery from method. Instead of tableQuery.from, tableService.queryEntities takes table and tableQuery may be null to represent retrieving all entities in the table.
* TableQuery select is an instance method for consistency with top and where. Instead of TableQuery.select('foo'), use new TableQuery().select('foo').
* TableQuery provides helper methods to create filter strings to use with the where clause for a query. Query strings may also include type specifiers where necessary.
  For example, to query on a long value, users could do the following:
 	var tableQuery = new TableQuery().where(TableQuery.int64Filter('Int64Field', TableUtilities.QueryComparisons.EQUAL, '4294967296'));
	OR
	var tableQuery = new TableQuery().where('Int64Field == ?int64?', '4294967296');
